## Overview

This project utilizes the YOLOv5 framework to detect passports in images. YOLOv5 is a popular object detection model that provides fast and accurate results. The model has been trained on a custom dataset and fine-tuned to perform well on passport detection tasks.

## Installation

To get started with the project, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

git clone https://github.com/suv4tha/passport-detection-yolov5.git
cd passport-detection-yolov5
Then, install the required Python packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
Once the setup is complete, you can start using the model for inference or training. Hereâ€™s how you can run the detection on a sample image:

Detection
Ensure you have a trained model or weights in the weights/ directory.
Run the detection script:
bash
Copy code
python detect.py --weights path_to_weights --source path_to_image
Replace path_to_weights with the location of your trained model weights and path_to_image with the image you want to process.

Training
To train the model on your own dataset, run the following command:

bash
Copy code
python train.py --data data.yaml --cfg models/yolov5s.yaml --weights yolov5s.pt --batch-size 16 --epochs 100
This will start training the model on your dataset, which is specified in data.yaml.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of images of passports collected from various sources. You can customize the dataset by replacing the current dataset with your own images.

Model Training
To train the model, you can adjust the hyperparameters such as batch size, learning rate, and the number of epochs. The training process is automated and will generate model weights that can be used for inference.

You can monitor the training process using the built-in logger to track metrics like loss, precision, recall, and mAP.

Results
Once the model is trained, you can visualize the detection results by running the detection script with any test image or video.
